							<h2 class="text-center">Savings, Put Simply</h2>
							<p>Our data shows the price of solar energy was typically lower than the cost of electricity our customers bought from their utilities. The sooner you lock into a predictable price for solar energy, the sooner you may see avoided costs from the trend of rising electricity rates.*</p>
							<p>That said, your savings from going solar can vary from those estimated in your customized quote based on factors we can't control. These factors include future utility rates (which are up to your utility) and your home's future electricity usage (which is up to you). Ready to learn more?.</p>

							<h2 class="d-block text-center text-md-left">Analyzing Your Bills</h2>
							<p>The first step in calculating savings for our customized solar quotes is to analyze your current utility bills. Basically, our proprietary software looks at your utility bills from the prior 12 months, allows for seasonal variation, and incorporates both fixed and variable charges (to the extent applicable in your utility).
							</p>
							<p>In analyzing your bills, we take into account several important factors including
								<strong>fixed charges</strong>, which cover the utility's cost of providing
								electricity service and would be incurred with or without solar. These can be in
								the form of a monthly charge, or a minimum dollar amount on your bill. And
								<strong>variable charges</strong>, which reflect the price of electricity usage
								that can be directly offset with solar.
							</p>
							<p>Additionally, our bill analysis accounts for different rate structures:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>If your utility has <strong>tiered</strong> rates based on usage, we
									estimate your tiered rate based on the historical usage data provided by you.
								</li>
								<li>If your utility has <strong>time-of-use</strong> rates based when energy is
									used during the day, we estimate the time-of-use rate of a typical usage profile.
								</li>
								<li>If your utility has <strong>non-standard</strong> rate plans, for example, a
									different plan for Electric Vehicle users, we might be able to accommodate this as well — ask your solar consultant.
								</li>
								<li>Finally, your state or local government might offer credits that reduce your
									utility bill as an incentive for going solar. If it does, we account for these.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>It's important to know that while we use current utility data, actual future
								utility rates, charges, and fee structures are subject to change by your utility and other entities which Sungevity does not control.

							<h2 class="d-block text-center text-md-left">Making Year One Savings Projections</h2>
							<p>
								Using these bill estimates, your home's historic electricity usage, and your Sungevity
								Energy System's projected solar production, we first calculate Year One Savings Projections. Here's how that looks in our quotes:
							</p>
							<p><strong>Average Net Monthly Savings</strong> is an estimate of what you would
								save on electricity costs, on average, each month in the first year you go solar. To calculate it, we start with your yearly projected electricity costs without solar (what we call your Old Utility Bill) and subtract your yearly projected electricity costs with solar (Solar Payments and New Utility Bill). We then divide that number by 12 to give you a sense of what your average monthly savings in the first year after going solar would be, although in many instances your savings will vary each
								month due to seasonality and usage. 
							</p>
							<p>We then break this down for you. <strong>Without Solar</strong> shows an
								estimate of your
								average monthly electricity costs for the first year if you continued to
								purchase
								100% of your
								electricity from your utility.
							</p>
							<p><strong>With Solar</strong> shows an estimate of your average monthly electricity
								costs for the first
								year with your new energy mix. You would be generating your own electricity with
								predictable solar
								payments and purchasing less electricity from your utility, resulting in a lower
								average monthly
								utility electricity bill.

							<h2 class="text-center">Making 20-Year Savings Projections</h2>
							<p>To help you think about solar in the long run, we also calculate customized 20-year savings estimates (including Annual and Cumulative Net Savings for each year). To this, we extrapolate from your Year One Savings Projections.
							</p>
							<p>Specifically, we adjust your “Old Utility Bill” and “New Utility Bill” for each year based on projected <strong>Annual Utility Rate Increases</strong> to arrive at your “Utility Savings.” We then subtract your <strong>Solar Payments</strong> and add in any <strong>Solar Incentives</strong> that you may be eligible to receive based on the area you live in and what type of solar agreement you have chosen.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Annual utility rate increases</strong> are future projections derived from publicly available data. For most utilities, Sungevity bases its projections on a state-by-state analysis of the last
								ten years of available data regarding utility rates provided by the United
								States Energy Information Administration (“EIA”).
							</p>
							<p>For Investor Owned Utilities in California, including PG&amp;E, SDGE, and SCE, we use 3%, a figure adhered to by stakeholders in the Net Energy Metering proceeding, R14-07-002.
							</p>
							<p>Importantly, utility rate increases are projections and are not guaranteed by Sungevity. This is because actual future utility rates, charges, and fee structures are subject to change by your utility and other entities which Sungevity does not control. Of course, that highlights one of the biggest benefits of going solar with Sungevity — <strong>unlike with your utility, you'll be paying a predictable price for solar energy from your Sungevity Energy System.</strong>
							</p>
							<p>Most importantly, <strong>Solar Payments</strong> is our estimate of what you will pay for solar energy in a given year.** Here's how that works:
							</p>
							<p>
								<u>Options where you host the system</u>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>When you choose to lease the Sungevity Energy System, you get a set monthly payment, subject any annual escalator you select. We multiply this payment by 12 to get your annual total.</li>
								<li>When you choose a Sungevity Energy System power purchase agreement (PPA), you get a set solar rate per kWh, subject to any annual escalator you select. We multiply this rate by your estimated annual solar production to get your annual total.</li>
								<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
									<ul>
										<li>Production will vary over time due to a number of factors, including weather and shading, but we plan for this in your system design. We also build in an annual 0.5% degradation rate in
										estimating your system's future production.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<u>Options where you own the system</u>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>When you choose a cash purchase of the Sungevity Energy System, your only solar payment is the Upfront System Cost, which is paid in Year 1.
								</li>
								<li>When you choose to finance your purchase of a Sungevity Energy System with a loan from Solar Mosaic, Inc. loan, we sync up with Mosaic to estimate your Solar Payments. This includes your Monthly Loan Payments as well as a pre-payment in the amount of 30% of the initial loan amount that you may optionally make within the first 18 months of the loan.***
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Solar Incentives</strong> refers to estimated financial incentives that may be available to you if you purchase your Sungevity Energy System. These include the federal residential tax credit and state tax credits, state and local rebates, performance-based incentives, and solar renewable energy credits (to the extent generally available in your state and utility). These incentives may need to be applied for by you, are subject to change by entities outside of our control, and are not guaranteed by Sungevity.

							<h2 class="text-center text-white">Hey Wait, do Seasons Impact Savings?</h2>
							<p>As the amount of daylight changes with the weather and seasons, your solar production will also change. Solar panels produce more energy in the long days of summer than on shorter winter days. Similarly, sunny days generate more energy than cloudy days. It's normal to see seasonal variation in your solar production! That's why we analyze historical weather patterns in your area to design your system.</p>
							<p>If you select a power purchase agreement with a monthly payment plan, seasonality will also show up in your solar bills. You'd pay a set amount for each kWh your system actually produces, and this production level will vary from month to month. This means — generally — that your solar bill from July will be higher than in December because your system generates more solar energy in the summer. Of course, you'll also pay less when your system is producing less!</p>
